The goal of vector-to-raster alignment algorithm is to align vector data to the goegraphic objects, such as railroads, in the georeferenced maps.
This Github has three scripts. 

- readShp.py: process the shapefile, convert the shapefile into multiple txt files storing vector points. 
The script saves the txt files in a folder. The txt files are the inputs of the alignment.py
command: python inputs_generation.py /path/to/georeferenced_map /path/to/shapefile /path/to/outputs_folder

- alignment.py: the main script for the vector-to-raster alignment algorithm. The script saves the alignment vector data in a folder.
command: python alignment.py /path/to/txt_folder /path/to/map /path/to/output_folder

- rasterize.py: draw the vector data from the alignment script in a black image which is the same size of map.
command python rasterize.py /path/to/folder /path/to/map /path/to/output_map

Data is stored in Google Driver https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iwat21f3ji3jg68/AAAHhzwnPJ44JGLvYVAL65a1a?dl=0
The map is a USGS topographic historical map covered Bray, CA, circa 2001
It has two formats, tiff and png. Tiff is for readShp.py, and png is for alignment.py and rasterize.py
shapefile is the contemporary railroads vector data in the shapefile folder downloaded from the USGS website.
